# Benchmarking Process Considerations

There are a series of aspects that need to be taken into considerations when
performing benchmarks.

- Cost Implications
    - Financial Costs: Acquiring or renting hardware resources to run
      benchmarks.
    - Energy Costs: Running AI algorithms consumes computational resources and
      power.

- Sustainability
    - Environmental Sustainability
        - Responsible use of resources.
        - Minimizing carbon emissions.
        - Reducing ecological footprints.
    - Data Collection
        - Use efficient techniques to minimize environmental impact.
        - Reduce unnecessary data points.
        - Optimize data storage to lower energy consumption and emissions.
    - Energy-Efficient Practices
        - Prefer cloud-based or energy-efficient high-performance computing
          resources.
        - Use energy-efficient infrastructure for storing benchmarking results.

- Benchmarking Necessity
    - Avoid redundant benchmarking if AI assets are already benchmarked in
      sufficient detail.

- Collaboration and Standardization:
    - Promote collaboration among organizations to develop standardized
      benchmarking methodologies.
    - Foster transparency and reduce duplication of efforts.
    - Use standardized benchmarks to compare environmental performance and drive
      sustainable practices.
