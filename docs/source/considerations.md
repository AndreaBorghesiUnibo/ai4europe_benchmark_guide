# Benchmarking Process Considerations

There are a series of aspects that need to be taken into considerations when
performing benchmarks.

Starting from the cost, there are financial costs (such as acquiring or renting
hardware resources to run benchmarks), and energy costs, as running AI
algorithms consumes computational resources and power.

Sustainability is of paramount importance and different aspects should be
considered. The environmental sustainability should aim at a responsible use of
resources, minimizing carbon emissions, and reducing ecological footprints. The
data collection has also sustainable implications as well, and the use of
efficient techniques to minimize environmental impact should be fostered,
together with strategies to reduce unnecessary data points and optimize data
storage to lower energy consumption and emissions. Finally, all-around
energy-efficient practices should be adopted, such as preferring cloud-based or
energy-efficient high-performance computing resources, and using
energy-efficient infrastructure for storing benchmarking results.

Connected to the previous issues, the actual benchmarking necessity should be
taken into account, to avoid redundant benchmarking if AI assets are already
benchmarked in sufficient detail.  Finally, collaboration and standardization
actions should be taken, so as to promote collaboration among organizations to
develop standardized benchmarking methodologies. This would allow to foster
transparency and reduce duplication of efforts. Additionally, the usage of
standardized benchmarks allows for comparing environmental performance and drive
sustainable practices.
