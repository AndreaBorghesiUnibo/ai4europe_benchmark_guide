# Data Reproducibility Checklist

Datasets are among the potential outcome of a benchmarking activity. For the
sake of trustworthiness, the provider of the data should declare a series of
metadata accompanying any dataset upon its publication.

In practice, dataset providers should undergo the following checklist, ideally
providing the metadata required by each item in the list:
- ***Data Provenance***: it is crucial to include information about the dataset's
  origin, such as its source, data collection methods, and the timeframe in
which the data was collected. This metadata enables users to assess the
reliability and credibility of the dataset.
- ***Data Collection Methods***: detailed documentation on the procedures used to
  collect the data, including any instruments or tools employed, allows users to
evaluate the accuracy and potential biases present in the dataset.
- ***Sampling Techniques***: if the dataset is a sample of a larger population, it
  would be helpful to describe the sampling methods used, such as random
sampling, stratified sampling, or convenience sampling. This information would
assist users in understanding the representativeness of the data.
- ***Data Preprocessing***: including a description of any preprocessing steps applied
  to the data, such as cleaning, filtering, or transformation, serve to help
users understand how the raw data was processed and any potential impact on the
final dataset.
- ***Variables and Definitions***: clear definitions and descriptions of the variables
  present in the dataset, including their units of measurement, data types, and
possible values, would enable users to correctly interpret and analyze the data.
- ***Missing Data Handling***: the method used to treat missing or incomplete data
  (whether through imputation, exclusion, or other methods) needs to be clearly
stated. This information let users inspect any potential biases or
limitations resulting from missing data.
- ***Data Quality Measures***: it is important to document the metrics used to measure
  quality of the dataset (e.g., accuracy, completeness, consistency); this
allows to assess the reliability of the data.
- ***Privacy and Ethical Considerations***: it is paramount to provide the information
  regarding any privacy or ethical considerations associated with the dataset,
such as anonymization techniques used, consent procedures, or adherence to data
protection regulations. This serves to more easily ensure compliance with legal
and ethical standards.
- ***Versioning and Updates***: If the dataset undergoes changes or updates, the
  version information and a changelog to track modifications need to be
included. This helps understanding the evolution of the data over time (and to
roughly assess if any compatibility issue has to be taken into account).
- ***Licensing and Usage Terms***: stating the licensing terms of the dataset is
  fundamental, as to indicate users' rights and obligations when working with
the data; any limitation on data usage, redistribution or modification needs to
be included.
